Retail Analytics – Customer 360

This project focuses on building an end-to-end Retail Analytics system that transforms raw transaction data into actionable customer insights. The solution analyzes customer purchasing behavior using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, identifies high-value and churn-risk customers, discovers product bundling opportunities, and presents insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard. The entire analytics pipeline is fully automated using Python ETL and Windows Task Scheduler, enabling regular data refresh with zero manual intervention.
